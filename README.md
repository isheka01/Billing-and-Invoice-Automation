# Billing-and-Invoice-Automation
Description
This project is a React application that integrates Google OAuth for user authentication and includes a billing/invoice section with automated invoice generation using Zapier.
Setup Instructions
Setting Up Your React Project
Clone the Repository:

Clone your React project repository from GitHub to your local machine.
Install Node Modules:

Open your project directory in the terminal.
Run npm install to install all the necessary Node.js modules specified in your package.json file.
Add Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root of your project.
Add your Google OAuth client ID and client secret:
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
Start the Development Server:

Run npm start to start the development server.
Your React application should now be running locally.
Google OAuth Login Integration
Navigate to Google Developer Console:

Go to the Google Developer Console.
Create a new project.
Enable the Google OAuth API and set up OAuth consent screen details (scopes, etc.).
Configure OAuth Credentials:

Generate OAuth client ID and client secret.
Add authorized redirect URIs (e.g., http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback for local development).
Implement Google OAuth in React:

Use a library like react-google-login to handle Google OAuth integration.
Follow the library's documentation to set up Google OAuth login in your React application.
Billing and Invoice Section
Design UI for Billing/Invoice Form:

Create components for entering billing details (name, email, client name, bank account, items, price, quantity, address).
Use form validation to ensure data correctness.
Handle Form Submission:

Implement logic to handle form submission.
Validate and sanitize user inputs on the server-side (if applicable).
Automated Billing and Invoice Generation with Zapier:

Sign up or log in to Zapier.
Create a new Zap (Zapier automation) with a trigger and an action.
Set up an action to generate an invoice using a Zapier-supported invoice generation tool (e.g., Google Docs, QuickBooks, etc.).
Map form data to invoice fields in Zapier.
Demonstrate the End-to-End Flow
Login with Google OAuth:

Open your React application.
Click on the Google OAuth login button.
Authorize access to your Google account.
Enter Billing/Invoice Details:

Fill out the billing/invoice form with sample data.
Verify that the form displays entered data in real-time.
Submit the Form:

Click on the submit button to send the form data to your backend or Zapier integration.
Automated Billing and Invoice Generation:

Check your configured destination (e.g., Google Sheets, invoice generation tool) to verify that the billing/invoice was generated automatically.
Print and Download Invoice:

Implement functionality to print or download the generated invoice from your React application.

Google OAuth Login
Prepare Your Application:
Ensure your React application is running locally (npm start).
Make sure your Google OAuth credentials (client ID and client secret) are correctly set in your .env file.
Access the Login Page:
Open your web browser and navigate to your React application's URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
Initiate Google OAuth Login:
On your application's login page, click on the Google OAuth login button.
Authorize Access:
You'll be redirected to Google's login page. Enter your Google credentials if you're not already logged in.
Authorize your React application to access your Google account data.
Successful Login:
After authorization, you should be redirected back to your React application.
Verify that you are logged in and can access restricted content or features based on the user's authentication status.
Viewing Usage Details
Navigate to Usage Details Section:
Within your React application, navigate to the section that displays usage details.
Display Relevant Information:
Ensure that the usage details section shows relevant data, such as user activity, services utilized, or any other metrics you want to showcase.
Interactive Elements (Optional):
Include interactive elements like charts, graphs, or tables to visualize usage data if applicable.
Verify Data Accuracy:
Check that the displayed usage details accurately reflect the user's activities or metrics tracked by your application.
Automated Billing and Invoice Generation using Zapier
Prepare Form Data:
Within your React application, navigate to the billing/invoice section.
Fill out the form with sample data, including name, email, client name, items, price, quantity, etc.
Submit the Form:
Click on the submit button to send the form data to your backend or Zapier integration.
Zapier Automation:
Log in to your Zapier account.
Navigate to the Zap editor to create a new Zap.
Set Trigger:
Choose a trigger app (e.g., Google Sheets) and set up the trigger event (e.g., new row added).
Map Data and Actions:
Map the form data fields to corresponding columns in Google Sheets (or your chosen destination).
Configure actions to generate an invoice using Zapier-supported tools (e.g., Google Docs, QuickBooks).
Test and Activate the Zap:
Test your Zap to ensure data mapping and actions work as expected.
Once satisfied, activate the Zap to run automatically based on trigger events.
Verify Invoice Generation:
After form submission in your React application, check the configured destination (e.g., Google Sheets) or invoice generation tool to verify that the billing/invoice was generated automatically via Zapier.
Print and Download Invoice:
Implement functionality in your React application to allow users to print or download the generated invoice.
